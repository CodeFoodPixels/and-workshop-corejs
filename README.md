# CORE JS WORKSHOP

## Getting Started...

1. fork and clone this repo on your machine
2. install or update nodejs to the latest version (8): `brew install node`
3. install [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) globally: `npm install -g jest`
4. install nodemon globally: `npm install -g nodemon`
5. install node modules: `npm install`

** You should run the test individually **

`jest --watch <test-file>`

For the non test file, use nodemon to automatically load the change you (eventually) make

```
nodemon <file>
```

## Contributing:

- Each sub section should contain:

  - Explanation file for the concept (Use Docco to go through the concept). Create a js file within `/src`, where your explanation is written in comments
  - Test javascript file (this if for the exercise) within `/exercises`

- Run the following commands to generate the doc files
  - `./node_modules/.bin/docco exercises/*`
  - `./node_modules/.bin/docco src/*`
